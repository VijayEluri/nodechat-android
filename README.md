# Android NodeChat #
### Foreword ###

This is a project for a Network Application Design course. It is not actively developed or bug free, though feel free to fork. 

### About ###

This is an Android client that will connect to the example node.js chat room [https://github.com/ry/node_chat](https://github.com/ry/node_chat) (chat room demos at [http://chat.nodejs.org/](http://chat.nodejs.org/). The application interfaces with a server running the node.js chat room in the same manner the browser version does.

I started this for an assignment for a course involving Android development and to play with node.js -- feel free to contribute! If there is enough interest/contributions, I will publish to the Android Market.
